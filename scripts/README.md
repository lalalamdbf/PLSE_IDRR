# Hyperparameter Error Correction

In Section 4.2 of our paper (Camera Ready of EMNLP 2023), which delineates the intricacies of the pre-training, we rectify a numerical discrepancy related to the learning rate. The accurate learning rate is 5e-6, as opposed to the initially stated 1e-5. This correction has been implemented in the pretrain_plse.sh file and [the arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00367) of the paper.
